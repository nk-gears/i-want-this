# LinkedIn Groups

## Problem 
- Have been in multiple groups related to School, Old Office Groups
- There is no way of what our friends are working now unless we ask them in the group
- Sometimes any Professional help can be asked to our known group instead of searching somewhere.

## Solution
- An App which collates all the members Linked In Profiles and Showcases them in a Site
- How it works ?
  - WhatsApp Group Admin, Updates the Description of the Group with this Link https://grouplink.appdews.com/<group_name>
  - Any Members in that Group can Open that Link
  - That Link will show list of all the members Linked In Profile with an Additional Button, "Add Mine"
  - When the user Clicks the Button, It will take the user to Sign In using Linked In
  - Then that user will be added to that Group. Before adding it will ask a PIN which the WhatsApp Group Admin can Share to others
