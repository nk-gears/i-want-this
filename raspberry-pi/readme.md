# Projects using Raspberry Pi

Infrared Remote Control

- Run Custom Scripts via Infrared Device
- Use any Old TV Remote Device and Create Configuration using LIRC


Thoughts :

- Worked Well almost 10 metres distance.
- I was using this for running custom scripts and controlling the switches and audio devices.

Am I using this now ?

- As of 2020, I stopped using the Infrared Remote with Raspberry PI to Control any Home Automation.The main reason is the LIRC Daemon Service is consuming more CPU than I expected. Now I am using a OLD Keyboard based Connection to Send Commands to RPI Script
