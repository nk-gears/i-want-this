# Twixer 

A Self-Hosted App similar to Twitter to add twix on any topic. Quickly search, organize and categorize information.

Why I need this.

- When researching and experimentig, we come across lot of concepts and we take time to analyze and understand. All these things tend to forget soon once that task is over. There is no way to tag this somewhere and even if we tag it, we get lost without a way to searhc them.
- It happend for me multiple times especially while learning some of the AWS Concepts
- Then we will try to search internet and again we need to start from scratch.
- What if we tag this on our own words and it quickly becomes a refresher for that specific concept
- Moreover, we can also keep the message in short form like tweets. If it worth we can make this to be posted to public platform

Features
- Technical Concepts, Personal Journal, Ideas, Quotes
- Post them to Twitter
- Keep them Private
- Bullet Point Stories. Easy to Digest
