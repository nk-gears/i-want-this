### Nook Simple Touch Customization - Rooted

### Features

- I already rooted the NST and Installed a custom Quote Frame App (Modified from ElectricSign)
- Now i want to control the Output by customizing the buttons (Simple Press and Long Press) to show different content feeds
- By default it will show the content frame. But i should able to customize the call by sending a Event to MSMQ Remotely
