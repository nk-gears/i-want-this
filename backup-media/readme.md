# Backup Media from smart phones

There are multiple apps for iOS and android to backup photos and media to cloud and has. I like the sweet home app which does a fantastic job of backing up the files and pushing them to a local has at a faster speed.

But this app seems to failing recently with the authentication errors and it's no more usable.

Looking for an alternative

- should able to delete the local phone files once the backup is done
- able to uickl browse through all the files
